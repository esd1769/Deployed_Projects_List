I have the following directories in C:\Users\emstar\AppData\Roaming (or Local):

Code
GitHub Desktop
KRLauncher
KR_G153
Python
Trae

Please provide me a **single block of Windows CMD commands** to:

1. Move **only these** folders to D:\moved-local-data\
2. Delete the originals from C:\Users\emstar\AppData\Roaming (or Local)
3. Create symbolic directory links (symlinks) from the original location pointing to the new D: drive location

Make sure to use `robocopy` with `/MOVE` to move folders and `mklink /D` for symlinks.

Give me the exact commands I can copy and paste into an elevated Windows Command Prompt.
